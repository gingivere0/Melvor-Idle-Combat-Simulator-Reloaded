- After installing the extension, a refresh of the game may be required.
- Do not activate multiple instances of the extension at once.

## Bug reports
Raise an [issue](/../../issues) here on GitHub, or visit the #scripting-and-extensions channel on the [official Melvor Idle Discord](https://discord.gg/melvoridle).  
When reporting bugs please include:
- any required reproduction steps (e.g. a settings export, the monster you simulated, etc.)
- any console errors

## Installation
### Firefox:
Get the add-on [on AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/combat-simulator-reloaded/).

### Chromium-based browsers:
**(Chromium, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, Kiwi Browser, etc.)**  
Get the extension [on the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/melvor-idle-combat-simula/cgggfndkphggbgeimpplooflemnfndok).  
For some of the chromium-based browsers (e.g. Microsoft Edge) you have to specifically allow "extensions from other stores".

### Install a pre-release, or install any version from source
1. Download the version of your choice (clone the repo; [latest master source](/../../archive/refs/heads/master.zip); [latest version](/../../releases/latest); etc.)
2. If zipped, extract the files.
3. Install the extension: [chromium instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#unpacked), [firefox instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7el77F1ckg)  
   Depending on your browser you will have to point to the manifest file directly or to the Extension directory containing it.

### Mobile
The Melvor Idle mobile app does not support extensions. However, some mobile browsers allow extensions from the chrome web store (e.g. Kiwi Browser on Android), in these browser you can then use the simulator.

## Quick Guide
The combat simulator allows you to configure a combat setup and simulate monsters, dungeons, and auto-slayer.

You can find the simulator by clicking the Combat Simulator button in the Tools section in the game's sidebar, between Non-Combat and Minigame.

 - The simulation of a monster will end if the maximum number of ticks (default 1k \* 1k = 1M) is exceeded, or when the desired number of trials have been simulated.
   - **"\# Trials"** is the number of fights that are simulated for each monster. Default is 1000.
   - **"Max tick/trial"** is the maximum number of ticks per trial. The ticks are pooled over all trials for a monster. Default is 1000, this corresponds with 20s fights.
 - If **"Heal After Death"** is enabled, food will be consumed after a player death to bring the player back to full health. If it is disabled, the next fight will begin with the default health (20%). Enabled by default.
 - If **"Has Runes"** is disabled, the simulator will assume that the player has no runes, and no spells will be cast. Enabled by default.
 - **Settings Export** creates a JSON string with the current setup in the sim and copies it to your clipboard. If the clipboard is not available, a modal containing the JSON is opened instead.
 - With **Settings Import** you can paste a settings export JSON string in the text box, and import it to the sim with the button.
 - **Data Export** creates a JSON string with the current simulation results, and copies it to your clipboard. If the clipboard is not available, a modal containing the JSON is opened instead.
   - If **Dungeon Monsters** is enabled, all monsters in a dungeon will be included in the data export JSON.
   - If **Non-Simulated** is enabled, entities that were not simulated will be included in the data export JSON.

## Notes for Mozilla Reviewers
> This add-on is a simulation tool for a browser game (Melvor Idle). We run "eval" on some functions and classes in a web worker, these functions and classes are part of the page where the content script is injected, some of these are modified by the script before passing them to the web worker. Here, "eval" is used to recreate a modified version of the game environment in web workers. This functionality can not be replicated with "window.Function". The performance hit is minimal, since this environment only has to be created once at the start of the session.
